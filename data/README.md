-   `HAM10000_segmentations_lesion_tschandl`: The directory containing the masks for the train images
-   `HAM10000_metadata_train.csv`: The .csv file containing the metadata for the images (labels and other info) which will be split into train, validation and test set
-   `HAM10000_augmented_images`: The directory containing the GAN generated images to augment the training set
-   `synthetic_metadata_train.csv`: The .csv file containing the metadata for the GAN generated images.
